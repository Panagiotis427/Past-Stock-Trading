# Past-Stock-Trading

This project is about finding an optimal algorithm of N at most proper stock exchange transactions of the form {buy-open, buy-low, sell-high, sell-close}, based on the Huge Stock Market Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs), in order to gain the best possible balance, after evaluation.

Two algorithms are presented; one for N = 1,000 and one for N = 1,000,000.
